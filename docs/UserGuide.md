# PlanPerfect User Guide
PlanPerfect is designed to streamline the way wedding planners manage their contacts and organize wedding events. 
With PlanPerfect, you can store essential contacts—from photographers and florists to caterers and entertainers—in one convenient place. 
Easily assign these contacts to specific weddings, helping you stay organized and focused on delivering seamless, unforgettable events. 


Whether you’re coordinating one wedding or multiple, PlanPerfect provides the structure you need to keep everything running smoothly.


PlanPerfect is **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** 
(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, PlanPerfect can get 
your wedding contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar PlanPerfect.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## General Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Parameter descriptions containing a `...` indicate that the parameter can take one or more inputs or no inputs at all (only if inside an optional bracket).<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG1 TAG2 ...]` can be ignored (i.e. 0 tags) or replaced with `t/friend` (i.e. 1 tags) or `t/friend family` (i.e. 2 tags) etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Providing unexpected parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `sort`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Wedding-related Features
### Add wedding: `addw`

Format: `addw n/WEDDING_NAME d/DATE (in DD/MM/YYYY format) [c/CONTACT1_INDEX CONTACT2_INDEX ...]`

Adds a wedding to PlanPerfect with the specified date. Optionally allows users to pre-assign contacts to the wedding.

* Contact indexes must be valid in the context of the current view
  * IMPORTANT: If you want to pre-assign contacts when adding a wedding, you are encouraged to use `list` to view all contacts BEFORE using the addw command to add a new wedding. If you are in a wedding view, and you do not use the `list` command to exit from wedding view to the all contacts view, you will only be able to add contacts from the current wedding being viewed into the new wedding.

Examples:
* `addw n/Arif and Sonali Wedding d/30/04/2025`

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

<br><br/>

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, PlanPerfect will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause PlanPerfect to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

</box>

### Setting your own tag colors

User preferences are saved in the JSON file `[JAR file location]/preferences.json`. Advanced users are welcome to edit the 'TagColours' field in the JSON with custom hex values (colour codes) in order to customise the UI to your liking.<br>

<br><br/>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
